Simple NewsRoom App. News are listed in order basing on upvotes. We can add news or upvote/downvote/remove them.

Second is NgPizza, which allows us to work with API. We can add pizzas and delete them. There is also comment section, but it only allows us to fetch comments without the option of editing nor deleting them.

To be fair it’s not much and it’s definately underdeveloped. I’m only uploading this to mention that I was introduced to Angular and yet I’m not interested in developing this relationship but hey – you never know, right?

To start application, use your terminal:
npm i
ng serve -o
